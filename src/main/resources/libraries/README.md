# FMOD Libraries Setup

## Important Licensing Notice

**The FMOD DLL files are NOT included in this repository due to licensing restrictions.**

According to FMOD's licensing terms, we cannot distribute the FMOD runtime libraries (DLLs) with our mod. You must download and install them yourself.

## Required Files

You need to place the following files in this directory (`src/main/resources/libraries/`):

- `fmod.dll` - FMOD Core Engine library
- `fmodstudio.dll` - FMOD Studio API library

## Download Instructions

1. **Download FMOD Engine**
   - Go to: https://www.fmod.com/download#fmodengine
   - Download **FMOD Engine version 2.02.16** (or compatible version)
   - You may need to create a free FMOD account

2. **Install FMOD Engine**
   - Run the installer
   - Complete the installation process

3. **Locate the DLL files**
   - Navigate to your FMOD Engine installation folder
   - Look for the `api/core/lib/x64/` and `api/studio/lib/x64/` directories
   - Copy `fmod.dll` and `fmodstudio.dll` from these locations

4. **Place the files**
   - Copy both DLL files to this directory: `src/main/resources/libraries/`
   - The mod will automatically load these libraries at runtime

## File Structure

After setup, this directory should contain:
```
src/main/resources/libraries/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md (this file)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fmod.dll
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ fmodstudio.dll
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Missing DLL errors**: Ensure both `fmod.dll` and `fmodstudio.dll` are present in this directory
2. **Version mismatch**: Make sure you downloaded FMOD Engine version 2.02.16
3. **Architecture mismatch**: Ensure you're using the x64 (64-bit) versions of the DLLs
4. **Permission errors**: Make sure the DLL files are not read-only

## üîÑ Automatic Fallback System

**Note: FMOD DLL files are NOT currently shipped with the JAR due to licensing restrictions.**

The FMOD API mod uses a three-tier loading system:

1. **üéØ Primary**: Load from JAR resources (`/libraries/` folder) - **Currently empty, requires manual setup**
2. **üîÑ Secondary**: Load from system-installed FMOD (if you have FMOD Engine installed)
3. **üõ°Ô∏è Tertiary**: Fall back to OpenAL (always works)

### How the Fallback Works
- If you **don't place DLLs in the JAR** (current default), the mod will try to find FMOD on your system
- If you **have FMOD Engine installed**, the mod may automatically detect and use it
- If **neither works**, the mod gracefully falls back to OpenAL

### For Best Results
- **Recommended**: Place the DLL files in this directory for guaranteed compatibility
- **Alternative**: Install FMOD Engine system-wide and let the mod auto-detect it
- **Fallback**: OpenAL will always work as a backup
